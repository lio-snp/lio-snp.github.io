## Background

My research started from one simple question: how do different kinds of data "take shape" in real systems?
How images encode structure, how trades evolve over time, and how text distributes in semantic space.
That curiosity led me to the intersection of **alternative data**, **financial risk**, and **explainable modeling**.

## Academic Path

- **B.S. in Management Information Systems**  
  SWUFE × University of Delaware Joint Program (2022–2026, anticipated)
- GPA 4.1/5.0 (91/100), Rank 3/62, IELTS 7.0
- Core coursework: ML, Data Structures, Mathematical Statistics, Optimization, Business Application Programming

## Method Preferences

1. Define an auditable problem framing and evaluation protocol first.  
2. Build cross-source feature pipelines (structured + climate/geospatial + behavioral signals).  
3. Evaluate robustness, interpretability, and deployment viability, not only one-off metrics.  

## Current Directions

- Remote-sensing climate signals for SME credit-risk prediction.  
- Trustworthy and explainable evaluation in financial AI.  
- Mechanism validation for RL in investor-behavior modeling.
